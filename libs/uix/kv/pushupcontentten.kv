Place your free hand on a basketball which is out to the side of the body. It should be as far away as you can reach while keeping your palm flat on the ball. Both your arms should be straight. This is the start position (fig. 17). Slowly, and under full control, lower yourself down until your chest is one fist's width away from the floor. As with full pushups, you can use a baseball or tennis ball to check your depth if you are training alone. The act of lowering yourself will cause the basketball to roll out further to your side (fig. 18). Pause briefly in the bottom position, then push yourself back up."
