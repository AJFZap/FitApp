Kick up into a wall handstand next to the basketball using whichever technique you find easiest, then reach out and place one of your palms on the basketball. This motion sounds simple but is in fact very difficult; it will require supporting your bodyweight on one locked arm for a fraction of a second, or as long as it takes to find the ball. Once your palm is secured on the basketball, position it so that your hands are about shoulder width apart. The arm of the hand which is on the floor should be straight, but your other arm will be bent. Apply your weight as evenly as you can through both hands, breathing smoothly. Your triceps, biceps and shoulders need to work very hard at this point, or you may lose control of the ball and crash down. This is the start position (fig.119). Now bend at the elbows and shoulders until the head gently touches the floor. This is the finish position (fig.120). Pause, and press back up."
