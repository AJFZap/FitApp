The feet should be shoulder width apart or slightly closer. Place the hands alongside the head, with the palms flat on the floor and your fingers pointing towards your toes. Your elbows should be angled towards the ceiling at this point. Now push the hips as high as you can, lifting the body from the floor. Continue pushing through your arms and legs until your back is well arched, and your hips are high. The head should be tilted down, with the crown of your skull pointing towards the floor. This is a bridge hold. Retain this position momentarily, before bending at the arms and legs until the top of your skull very gently touches the floor. This is the start position (fig.89). Pause again briefly, before pushing yourself back up to the bridge (fig.90). This is the finish position. Go carefully, so that you don't bang your head. Maintain the deep arch in the back all the way throughout the set, breathing as normally as possible all the way through. When you have finished all your reps, smoothly lower your shoulders, back and hips to the floor."
