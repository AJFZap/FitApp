                    text: "Kick up into a handstand against a sturdy wall. As usual, your arms should be shoulder width apart and your fingers should be six to ten inches from the wall with only your feet touching the surface. This will leave a slight natural curve in your body. As with Level 8, slowly transfer the majority of your weight-approximately ninety percent-onto one palm. Now flip your other palm over, so that the back of hand is flat on the floor with the fingers pointing away from you. Straighten out your arm in front of you, maintaining contact with the floor as you go. Some pressure should still be flowing through the digits of this hand. This is the start position (fig.123). Keeping the arm of the upturned hand extended, bend at the shoulder and elbow of your other arm, with full muscular control-don't just allow your body to drop or you will hurt your head and possibly even crick your neck in the process. Pause as the top of your skull softly touches the floor. This is the finish position (fig.124). Now, press back up to the start position, pushing through your palm and the back of your hand simultaneously."
