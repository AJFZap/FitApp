Pressing down with the hands will help you keep your torso stable. This is the start position (fig. 70). Now, keeping your legs locked, raise your feet until they are directly above your pelvis. Exhale as you lift, keeping the stomach tight. It should take you at least two seconds to smoothly accomplish this-don't explode up. Your legs and torso will form a right angle at this point. This is the finish position (fig.71). Pause briefly, before reversing the motion exactly, inhaling as you go down. Pause again in the start position and repeat. At no point should allow your knees to unlock, and your heels shouldn't touch the floor until the set is completed."
