                    text: "Grab an overhead bar with one hand, using your strongest gripping position. For some people, this will be an overhand grip; for others, side-on or underhand. Using a hanging ring is probably ideal for most people. Place your other arm anywhere that seems comfortable. Set yourself (by jumping, kipping, using a chair, etc.) so that your lifting arm is bent halfway. The elbow should be at a right angle, with your upper arm parallel to the ground. Your feet should be clear of the floor and looped behind you as for previous steps. The shoulder of your lifting arm should be tightly braced, and your whole body flexed. This is the start position (fig. 55). Bend at the elbow and shoulder and smoothly pull your body up until your chin is over the height of the bar. This is the finish position (fig. 56). Pause at the top, before slowly lowering yourself back down to the start position. Pause at the bottom and repeat."
